# CCurrent AFM AutoSkript

## Overview

Python script for autonomous Current AFM scans evaluation. It will treat a number of scans simultaneously and correlate topographic and current data and make a statistic evaluation of the whole stack of images.

""" Writer: Tillmann Stralka 2020.Mai.05 Owner: HLP University of Leipzig About: Python version 2.7 Automatic procession of AFM files. Finding, listing, fitfunctions, image making, statistic extraction and plotting Correlation of Current and topographic information, convolution of dynamicscans """

The script was created as part of Tillmann Stralka's doctoral thesis. Please refer to it for further questions and information: "Electrical Atomic Force Microscopy Applied on Copper Iodide Thin Films and Crystals - 17.06.2024 - Tillmann Stralka"

## Project Steps

1. **Data Collection**: 
   - Collect data from the path
   - Unpack and 
   - bla 

2. **Data Organization**:
   - 
   
3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Create visualizations to show dependencies between brands, specifications, and fuel types.
   
## Technologies Used

- Python
- gwyddion /pygwy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TilloStralka/Current_AFM_AutoSkript.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the main analysis:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Data

The data is was collected by the author in the lab and is  **not included in the repository** due to size and privacy constraints.
